        <p class="lead text-justify">
          The Investment Banking division of Danareksa helps companies and governments by raising funds through issuing
          and selling securities in the capital markets (both equity and bond),
          as well as providing advice on transactions such as mergers and acquisitions.
          In funds raising business, clients can derive value from our recognized strength in capital resources as well as extensive network among domestic and global financial institutions,
           which make for a successful underwriting exercise, from book building process up to the sale of securities.
     <br>
     <br>
             In 2015, I was interning at <i>Investment Banking Danareksa Securities</i> in which I
          learned on the technique of updating business research every morning from newspapers and
          summarize information that related to corporate clients. Other than that, this internship also
          thought me how to analyze the mining industry (such as understanding the pricing condition and
          how to estimate the price of goods in the mining industry), perform <i>DuPont analysis calculation</i>
          task for client investment prospects (such as understanding how to calculate with <i>DuPont
          analysis</i>), and doing the task of inputting client company financial report data for the past 5
          years (understanding how to compile financial statement). Beyond the tasks that I was given, I
          have also received training in <i>financial modeling</i> in which it thought me how to input data to
          excel, <i>Bloomberg application</i> to understand how to use the application properly for early user,
          and received lecture regarding the introduction of capital market presented by Mr. Jenpino, the
          President Director of <i>Danareksa Securities</i>. From this experience, I also gained knowledge on
          how to prepare documents before an important meeting with clients. From this intern
          program, I gained plenty of new financial skill that has never been thought in school, as well as
          understanding the office environment. I’m glad I could be a part of <i>Investment Banking
          Danareksa Securities</i>, which provided me knowledge and experience that I’ve never had before.

          collaboration with more than 50 local artists which commercially sold by auction.
          The growing number of artist who wants to collaborate attract us to keep chasing our purpose to upscale our position

            The level of appreciation that our people give to the art society is sadly, pretty low,

     <br>
     <br>
            In the beginning of 2017, when I went back to my hometown Jakarta, my cousin somehow convinced me to invest in <i>Bitcoin</i>, Yes, the infamous <i>Cryptocurrency</i> on January 2017 equates to USD 937.
          I had no idea why should I invest in Bitcoin, since I wasn't interested nor cared about it. Then in April 2017, I went back again to my hometown and Bitcoin equates to USD 1.447, growing up (+85%) only in 2 months.
          With the value increase up to 85%, I was shocked and grew interest to do further research on Bitcoins. Later, the research became the basis for <a href="http://pustaka.unpad.ac.id/archives/170505" target="_blank">my undergradate thesis.</a>
      <br>
      <br>
            While I was doing research on this matter, I realized that the crucial thing about this whole <i>cryptocurrency</i> debacle was not the Bitcoin value, but the <i>Blockchain</i>.
            A digital core and decentralized ledger that is unhackable and allow users to be private with their own data.
            Institutions, such as banks, no longer able to sell their customer's data to a third party and hackers no longer able to steal data/money caused by centralization.
            All of these benefits are caused by a number of reasons. First, thanks to the encryption system known as a <i>private-key encryption</i>,
            private data are transmitted between two parties securely in a split second.
            It is very difficult for hackers to hijack or intercept the transmission when a jumbled up encrypted data needs to be decrypted quickly before reaching it's destination.
            Second, blockchain uses <i>Peer-to-peer (P2P) network</i> to validate data movement from one point to another.
            A group of nodes (devices with computing powers with its own unique IP addresses) will validate the transaction according to the protocol that is set by the system.
            If you've heard the term <i>Bitcoin or cryptocurrency mining</i>, this is essentially what they're doing.
            Validated transactions will then lead to the third point, where the processed data will be added to the blockchain ledger, known as blocks.
            These blocks then are chained together, hence the term "Blockchain". When a new block is added to the chain, the data that has been processed can never be edited.
            If past data is edited (or "hacked"), the whole chain will change form and the rest of the nodes in the P2P network will correct the "edited" ledger.
            The reason why these nodes are able to identify the "edited" ledger is because all of these nodes talk to each other and have a copy (be it it in full set, or partial) of the blockchain ledger.
            This decentralized system is a huge selling point for cryptocurrency and blockchain enthusiasts.

             This is just a basic explanation of what blockchain technology is. More often than not, people mistake blockchain technology to a blockchain product.
             It is very important to differentiate between the two. The technology is called a Blockchain Protocol whereas the product is called a Blockchain Application.
             A good analogy is to imagine Blockchain Protocols as train tracks and Blockchain Applications as trains.
             There are only a number of train tracks to be build upon, but new types of trains are launched daily.
             As an example, Bitcoin - the cryptocurrency, is an application whereas Bitcoin - the protocol, is the underlying technology.

             After I did research on this matter, it found out that all my cousins had mutual interests about blockchains. Based on this interest, we made a family company to do further research on blockchains.
             My position is as <i>Chief Finance Officer</i> and what I do is calculating the cashflow of the company for the next five years and analyzing the technical and fundamental cryptocurency. I also calculate the profitability of the computer's mining machining.
